ALWAYS use absolute paths starting from /home/leeo/Documents/code/thermalright-lcd-control/ when creating or editing files. NEVER create files in nested paths like /home/leeo/Documents/code/thermalright-lcd-control/home/leeo/Documents/code/thermalright-lcd-control/. Always verify current directory with pwd before file operations.
