# Overview

This fork extends the original Thermalright LCD Control project with enhanced GUI features, text effects, and improved usability. The goal is to provide a polished, user-friendly experience for customizing your Thermalright LCD display on Linux. This will be expanded to adding support for additional Thermalright products.

### New Features in This Fork

**Display Composition**
- 🖼️ Background controls with multiple scaling modes (Stretch, Fit, Fill, Centered, Tiled)
- 🎨 Background colour picker for solid colour backgrounds
- 🔲 Background opacity control with smooth slider
- 🎭 Draggable foreground image overlay with opacity and position controls

**Text & Metrics Display**
- 📅 Enhanced date widget with format options (Default, Short, Numeric) and weekday/year toggles
- ⏰ Enhanced time widget with 12/24-hour format, seconds, and AM/PM options
- 📊 CPU & GPU metrics (temperature, usage, frequency) with customizable labels, units, and positioning
- ✏️ 4 customizable free text widgets with individual font size control

**Text Effects**
- 🌑 Shadow effect with colour, X/Y offset, and blur radius
- ✨ Outline effect with colour and width control
- 🌈 Gradient text with two-colour selection and direction (vertical, horizontal, diagonal)

**Editing Tools**
- 📐 Snap-to-grid with configurable grid size (5-50px) and visual overlay
- 🔄 Display rotation (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°)

# Origional Project Overview

Thermalright LCD Control provides an easy-to-use interface for managing your Thermalright LCD display on Linux systems.

The application features both a desktop GUI and a background service for seamless device control.

I performed reverse engineering on the Thermalright Windows application to understand its internal mechanisms.

During my analysis, I identified four different USB VID:PID combinations handled by the Windows application, all sharing
the same interaction logic.

Since I have access only to the Frozen Warframe 420 BLACK ARGB, my testing was limited exclusively to this specific
device.

Also, this application implements reading metrics from Amd, Nvidia, and Intel GPU. My testing was limited to Nvidia GPU.

Feel free to contribute to this project and let me know if the application is working with other devices.

For backgrounds, i have included all media formats supported by the Windows application
and added the option to select a collection of images to cycle through on the display.

## Features

- 🖥️ **User-friendly GUI** - Modern interface for device configuration
- ⚙️ **Background service** - Automatic device management
- 🎨 **Theme support** - Customizable display themes and backgrounds
- 📋 **System integration** - Native Linux desktop integration

## Supported devices

| VID:PID   | SCREEN RESOLUTION |
|-----------|-------------------|
| 0416:5302 | 320x240           |
| 0418:5304 | 480x480           |
| 87AD:70DB | 320x320,480x480   |

## Installation

### Download Packages

Download the appropriate package for your Linux distribution from
the [Releases](https://www.github.com/rejeb/thermalright-lcd-control/releases) page:

- **`.targ.gz`** - For any distribution

### Installation

1. **Check** for required dependencies:
   /!\ Make sure you have these required dependencies installed:
    - python3
    - python3-pip
    - python3-venv
    - libhidapi-* or hidapi depending on your distribution

2. **Download** the `.tar.gz` package:
   ```bash
   wget https://github.com/windin101/thermalright-lcd-control/releases/download/1.3.1/thermalright-lcd-control-1.3.1.tar.gz -P /tmp/
   ```

3. **Untar** the archive file:
   ```bash
   cd /tmp
   
   tar -xvf thermalright-lcd-control-1.3.1.tar.gz
   ```

4. **Install** application:
   ```bash
   cd /thermalright-lcd-control
   
   sudo bash install.sh
   ```

That's it! The application is now installed. You can see the default theme displayed on your Thermalright LCD device.

## Troubleshooting

If your device is 0416:5302 and nothing is displayed:
- Check service status to see if it is running
- Try restart service
- Check service logs located in /var/log/thermalright-lcd-control.log

If your device is one of the other devices, contributions are welcome.
Here some tips to help you:
- Check service status to see if it is running
- Check service logs located in /var/log/thermalright-lcd-control.log
- If the device is not working then this possibly mean that header value is not correct.
See [Add new device](#add-new-device) section to fix header generation.
- If the device is working but image is not good, this means that the image is not encoded correctly.
See [Add new device](#add-new-device) section to fix image encoding by overriding method _`_encode_image`.

## Usage

### Launch the Application

- **From Applications Menu**: Search for "Thermalright LCD Control" in your application launcher
- **From Terminal**: Run `thermalright-lcd-control`

### System Service

The background service starts automatically after installation. You can manage it using:

# Check service status

sudo systemctl status thermalright-lcd-control.service

# Restart service

sudo systemctl restart thermalright-lcd-control.service

# Stop service

sudo systemctl stop thermalright-lcd-control.service

## System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04+ / Debian 11+ / Other modern Linux distributions
- **Python**: 3.8 or higher (automatically managed)
- **Desktop Environment**: Any modern Linux desktop (GNOME, KDE, XFCE, etc.)
- **Hardware**: Compatible Thermalright LCD device

## Add new device

In [HOWTO.md](doc/HOWTO.md) I detail all the steps I gone through to find out how myy device works and all steps to add
a new device.
